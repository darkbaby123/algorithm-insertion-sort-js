# Insertion Sort (JavaScript)

## TL;DR

This is my algorithm practise for [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort). I implemented the "slightly faster" version in Wikipedia.

## How to run  

You need yarn to install the packages. I found yarn is faster especially you have local cache. But of course you can still use npm.

```bash
yarn install
npm test
```
